        <h1>Books are not just objects, they are vessels of enlightenment.</h1>
        <p>
          Step into the bustling streets of 16th-century Antwerp, where the
          rhythmic clatter of printing presses fills the air. It’s here, in the
          heart of Europe’s most vibrant trade hub, that Christophe Plantin
          carved his name into history. A master bookbinder turned entrepreneur,
          Plantin’s journey began with a vision: to make knowledge accessible to
          all. Antwerp was not just his home but the epicentre of intellectual
          growth, trade, and artistic mastery. But Plantin’s dream was
          ambitious. He wanted to create books not just as objects but as
          vessels of enlightenment. His vision would reshape how the world
          shared ideas, paving the way for the modern publishing industry.

                Christophe Plantin arrived in Antwerp and worked as a bookbinder
                and leatherworker. Soon, he became a burgher of the city and
                decided to start his own printing business, seeing the potential
                of books to spread knowledge.

                Plantin opened his Officina Plantiniana with just one printing
                press. Though small, his work quickly gained attention because
                he focused on producing high-quality books. He believed books
                could help enlighten people.

                books.

                Plantin’s business reached its peak with more than twenty

                Estienne family in France with just four presses, Plantin’s
                operation was massive and influential.

        <p>
          Plantin didn’t just print books; he shared ideas that changed how
          people thought and lived. His books reached across Europe, helping
          scholars, scientists, and religious leaders spread their knowledge. By
          printing in many languages, he made these ideas accessible to more
          people. The books from Plantin’s presses weren’t just pages they were
          tools for change. They supported new ways of thinking during the
          Renaissance, spread ideas during the Reformation, and helped people
          learn about science. Plantin’s work shows how powerful books can be in
          connecting people and shaping history.

        <h1>Where printing history lives</h1>
        <p>
          The heart of Plantin’s success was his printing presses. Two of these
          presses, built around 1600, are the oldest in the world and can still
          be seen today. These presses helped Plantin produce books faster and
          better than anyone else.Today, these presses are on display at the
          Museum Plantin-Moretus in Antwerp. The museum also holds treasures
          like the 36-line Gutenberg Bible, one of the oldest printed Bibles in
          Europe, and the original Garamond typeface used in Plantin’s books.
